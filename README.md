# General Assembly Python Programming - Capstone Project
# A Loan Approval Predictor  ðŸ’µ
An application to assist loan applicants with an indication of whether their loan is likely to be approved or rejected based on the applicant's inputs.
This application has been created soley for educational purposes and is not intended for any other uses.

### How to use this
Install Python 3.10 or later versions.

### Problem statement
- Your problem statement. What is the problem you're trying to solve?
  - Potential loan applicants are unsure whether their loan would be approved or rejected until they spend considerable time discussing their finances with a financial institution, or worse, unknowingly submit an application only to have it rejected and impact their credit rating.

- A brief summary of your solution to the problem. Make this readable so a person without a technical background could understand how you solve the problem! If you can, include why your solution matters. (Brief: somewhere around 4-6 sentences, but this isn't a hard rule.)
  - An application which takes in the loan applicant's inputs and quickly provides an indication of whether their loan is likely to be approved or rejected. The future applicant can then decide whether it is worth pursuing a discussion with a financial institution or whether they to need to discuss their lending requirements with a more specialised lender/broker. This application can save a future loan applicant time and gives indication of how they should procede with their application.
